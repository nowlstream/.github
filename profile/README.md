# nowl

Nowl is a app to record or stream your stream completly online! (we also have a desktop version). Our web app can manage to stream and record your screen (even simultaniouly!) or just one app, one especific screen and more. Nowl is made by <a href="https://github.com/nikoidot">@nikoidot</a> and <a href="https://github.com/luanderfarias">@LuanderFarias</a>.

But unfortunaly we are not working on nowl, because of other projects. but we gonna get back sooon...
